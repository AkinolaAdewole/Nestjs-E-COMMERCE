This TypeScript code defines an entity class called UserEntity using the TypeORM library, 
which is commonly used for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Node.js applications.

Let's break down the code:

import { Roles } from "src/utility/common/user-roles.enum";: This line imports the Roles enum from the 
specified location, likely an enumeration that defines various user roles (e.g., USER, ADMIN, etc.).

import { Column, Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from "typeorm";: This line imports the necessary 
decorators (Column, Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn) from the TypeORM library.

@Entity('users'): This decorates the UserEntity class as an entity named 'users'. In the context of 
TypeORM, entities represent database tables.

export class UserEntity { ... }: This defines the UserEntity class, which represents a user entity 
that will be mapped to a database table.

@PrimaryGeneratedColumn() id: number;: This decorator marks the id property as the primary key for 
the entity. The PrimaryGeneratedColumn decorator indicates that this column will be automatically 
generated by the database upon insertion.

@Column() name: string;, @Column() email: string;, @Column() password: string;: These decorators mark 
the name, email, and password properties as columns in the database table. They specify the column 
types as string.

@Column({type:'enum', enum:Roles, array:true, default:[Roles.USER]}) roles: Roles[];: This decorator 
marks the roles property as a column in the database table. It specifies that the column type is an 
ENUM, indicating that the Roles enum values will be stored in this column. The array:true option 
suggests that it's an array of enum values. The default:[Roles.USER] option sets the default value for 
this column to be an array containing a single element, Roles.USER.

In summary, this code defines a UserEntity class with properties corresponding to columns in a database 
table. The class is decorated with TypeORM decorators to specify how the class properties should be 
mapped to the underlying database structure.
